## Info
- Basic building block of logic: Function
- An array is an ordered collection of values
- null & undefined both are empty values (absence of meaningful values), treat them similarly (recommendation)
- typeof null cannot be fixed due to potential web compatibility issues
- Dangerous: when the reader cannot tell what will happen
