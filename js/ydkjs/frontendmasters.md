## Info
- Basic building block of logic: Function
- An array is an ordered collection of values
- null & undefined both are empty values (absence of meaningful values), treat them similarly (recommendation)
- typeof null cannot be fixed due to potential web compatibility issues
- Dangerous: when the reader cannot tell what will happen
- prototype and this are vice versa in terms of understanding them
- bash language has **dynamic scope**, as bash is not compiled (no compile time scope), so it is justified
- abstract operation: ToPrimitive (for example: toNumber, toString, valueOf)

## Type coercion (avoid case)
- == with 0 or "" (or even " ")
- == with non-primitive
- == true or == false
