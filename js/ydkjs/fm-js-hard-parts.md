- What are the two core features of JavaScript mentioned: Going through code line by line (**thread of execution**), 2. Storing data and functions in computer memory

- What are two risky traps engineers often fall into when problem-solving: The researcher (spending too much time reading about a topic without writing code) and the Stack Overflower (copying code snippets without understanding them)
