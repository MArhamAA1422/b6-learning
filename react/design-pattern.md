## Notes
- use custom hooks, use components for separate all things, use inline func for basic things
- single responsibility principle, component should be as small as possible

## Common Design Pattern

#### Presentational (dumb)/ Container (smart)
Small components that only render UI and receive props (presentational). Larger components handle data fetching, state, and pass props down (container).

#### Compound Components

#### Context/Provider Pattern
Used to avoid prop drilling.

#### Custom Hooks
Encapsulate stateful logic used by multiple components.

#### HOC
Functions that take a component and return a new component.

#### Render Props
A component takes a **function as a child or prop** and calls it with some data. `<Data>{data => <UI data={data} />}</Data>`

#### Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components
Inputs whose value is driven by state are controlled `value={state} + onChange`. If **refs** are used to read values on submit, they're uncontrolled.

#### Facade / Adapter-like wrappers around UI libraries
Small wrapper components that adapt an external library component to your appâ€™s props or styling system (common in shadcn or AntD wrappers).
