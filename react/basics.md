## Intro to React
React is a JavaScript library (not a full framework) for building user interfaces (UI). It was created by Facebook (Meta) and is now open-source, used by millions of developers.

Core ideas:

- Component-based → UIs are broken into reusable, independent pieces (e.g., Button, Navbar, Card).

- Declarative → You describe what the UI should look like, React figures out how to update it.

- Virtual DOM → React efficiently updates only the parts of the page that change instead of reloading everything.

- Unidirectional Data Flow → Data flows downward from parent to child components, making apps more predictable.

## Why React
- Reusable Components → Write once, use anywhere (like LEGO blocks).
- Fast UI updates → Thanks to the Virtual DOM.
- Huge ecosystem, Cross-platform, Backed by Meta.
